		<p> My Name is John Bruno and I am 62 years old. I am married and a father of two boys. My wife's name is Paula and my oldest Son is Jonathan and my youngest son is Jeffery. I live in Warren New Jersey. I am presently retired from my first career which was a 40 year run in the Global Financial Services Industry known as "Wall Street". In my retirement I have been involved in 3 different busineeses to keep myself busy. The first has been Wall Street Auto Exchange which I founded to restore and sell antique cars. The second has been a Technology initiative to design and build an Equity Derivative platform to process "Delta Neutral" products.</p>

		<p>The third has been in the music industry. I have been a musician since I was 9. I play 5 different instruments. I was formally trained on the piano and in percussion. I later taught myself Guitar, Bass and Sax. I was in 3 locals of the Musicians Union and played Broadway Shows, Atlantic City shows and was a studio Musician on many popular late 70's songs. I have a fully quipped recording studio in my basement where I write, play and record music for myself or others and fully orchestrate skeleton songs that other Musicians send me. I am currently working on a  Tourism commercial for the State of New Jersey. </p>
